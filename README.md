## Planning protection

### Produce a plan

- You should know which techniques you've researched can actually be implemented in the BTEC Lab
  - E.g., we couldn't set up biometric authentication/training in the BTEC Lab
- We need to make a plan for protecting an organisation's IT systems
- We will then use this plan to secure a system, review our plan, and enhance & evaluate it afterwards

### Plan contents

- produce a detailed and realistic plan that clearly shows what you intend to do to protect the IT system from a range of security threats
- give clear and reasoned justification of choices you've made during planning (why you intend to do this)
- include technical reasoning for why you have selected particular methods and configuration, as well as why you have rejected others

### Organisational requirements

**This information will be in the assignment brief.**

The brief will contain:

- the scenario
  - about the organisation and their setup
- the task
  - what you're expected to do

Your plan **must show that you have read, understood, and taken this into account**.

### Legislative requirements

Same laws as 7AB, especially the Data Protection Act.

Your plan **must show that you have read, understood, and taken this into account** (e.g. in an intro or justification).

### Overview

- protect the IT system
- meet organisational and legislative requirements

The Unit explicitly states you must implement:

- group policies
- anti-virus/anti-malware
- firewall
- wireless security
- access control

Other measures can be implemented, too!

### Example: Betty's Bakery

We need to:

- set up appropriate user groups to demonstrate how to control access to each other's files
- connect to WiFi to demonstrate how to set up security for this type of network
- connect to the internet to demonstrate how to set up a Firewall to protect and restrict access to the system
- have anti-virus software installed and configured

## Planning and testing
