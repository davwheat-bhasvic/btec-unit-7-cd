## Planning protection

### Produce a plan

- You should know which techniques you've researched can actually be implemented in the BTEC Lab
  - E.g., we couldn't set up biometric authentication/training in the BTEC Lab
- We need to make a plan for protecting an organisation's IT systems
- We will then use this plan to secure a system, review our plan, and enhance & evaluate it afterwards

### Plan contents

- produce a detailed and realistic plan that clearly shows what you intend to do to protect the IT system from a range of security threats
- give clear and reasoned justification of choices you've made during planning (why you intend to do this)
- include technical reasoning for why you have selected particular methods and configuration, as well as why you have rejected others

## Planning and testing
